Despite the recent \$600 billion crash and the high volatility of the whole cryptocurrency market, interest in development and research on blockchains is growing. Reaching the scalability of more traditional payment processors like PayPal or VISA is still a hard problem for decentralized peer-to-peer networks like bitcoin. Heated debates about scalability solutions led to the creation of hardforks like bitcoin cash. For users to better understand the impact of changes to the bitcoin protocol on scalability and security and to find optimal solutions, we propose Bitcoin-like Blockchain Simulation System (BBSS). BBSS is a configurable bitcoin-like blockchain simulator. Its focus is on the visualisation of the simulation results to make every blockchain detail easy to understand. With block size limits, transaction fees, Segregated Witness and other features the Scalability Problem can be analysed. The optional attacks double-spending and transaction spam allow examination of security properties. The design and architecture allow large-scale simulations in a comparatively short amount of time.
