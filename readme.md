# VIBES: Fast Blockchain Simulations for Large-scale Peer-to-Peer Networks

Following the success of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger, Blockchain technologies are now gaining widespread adoption in a wide variety of applications, using a diversity of distributed ledger systems with varying characteristics. Properties of such systems are not sufficiently analyzed. To better understand the behavior of these systems, we established VIBES: a configurable blockchain simulator for large-scale peer-to-peer networks. With VIBES, users can explore essential characteristics and metrics of the network, investigate the interactions among nodes, and intuitively compare different simulation scenarios.
