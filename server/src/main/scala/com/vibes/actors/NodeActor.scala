/*
* The NodeActor represents both a full Node and a miner in the blockchain network. As
* described in Chapter 6, it is a good opportunity for future work to differentiate between
* both.
* In VIBES, each NodeActor has its own blockchain, pool of pending transactions
* (candidates for the next block) and neighbours. It also works to solve the next block in
* the chain. A Node has its own priority queue of executables and the next solution of
* a block by this Node is represented by the first executable of type MineBlock in the queue.
* As a reminder, a NodeActorâ€™s executables types are either MineBlock, IssueTransaction,
* PropagateTransaction or PropagateBlock.
* A vote is represented by a best guess (timestamped work request) sent to the
* Coordinator. The NodeActor sends votes to the Coordinator and is only allowed to
* execute a piece of work once the Coordinator has granted a permission based on the votes.
* Moreover, this Actor receives and propagates blocks from other Nodes in the network. If
* a received block comes from a longer chain, the Actor takes care to follow synchronization
* steps described in Section 2.7. The Node synchronizes its blockchain, pool of transactions,
* rolls back any orphan blocks and adds any valid transactions from orphan blocks back
* to the transaction pool if they are not already included in the chain. Besides blocks, the
* NodeActor also takes care to propagate and create transactions in the network.
